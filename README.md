## Specifications
Great job on Milestone1, you met all the required specifications laid out in the documentation. The HTML is impeccable and the directory structure matches what was outlined. Your content is also straight foreword and i am easily able to tell who your target demographic is. You did forget /vendor in your .gitignore that needs to be added ASAP.
## Feedback
The content for your Milestone1 was great, but the styling added was amazing. While the styling was not required, it helped make your content easier to read and more engaging. Unfortunately since the styling was not part of the assignment, it will not have any effect on your grade. I also want to caution you to keep your plans for PWP at a manageable scope. I recommend you create a plan that allows for a paired down site for the assignment that can then be customized
with a more complex interface after graduation

## Overall Feedback
Good job on Milestone2a. Directory structure, Html,  and content meet project requirements. I would like to see more commits for the project but I understand Milestone2a is a little different because you are creating images outside of PHPStorm.
### Wireframes
I wanted see more details in your wireframes. I have a great Idea of how your PWP will be styled but I have no idea what your actual UI will look like. Im also a little concerned with your about me section. What you laid out may require may require a lot of media queries and different Html structure for the desktop and mobile view.
### Content Strategy
Your content strategy barely meets requirements. I would of liked to see a lot more detail of what you are to doing with your UI. I would also like to see an explanation of how you plan use both Japanese and English in your site. The overlay of your name in Japanese and English was difficult to interpret, the content strategy would have been the best place to explain that. 
## Design Tips
I have full faith in your ability to crush Milestone2b and Milestone3. I do want to caution you to create something that is manageable for the scope of this project. Remember you'll have a lot of time to work on PWP after graduation, while applying for jobs.

## Moving Foreword
We'll be building PWP in a file named index.php inside of /public_html. Please note that no site files should live outside of the /public_html directory. Please use an organized and standards-compliant directory structure to house all images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. We are done with the /documentation directory from here out!
