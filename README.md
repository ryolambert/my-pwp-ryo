## Specifications
Great job on Milestone1, you met all the required specifications laid out in the documentation. The HTML is impeccable and the directory structure matches what was outlined. Your content is also straight foreword and i am easily able to tell who your target demographic is. You did forget /vendor in your .gitignore that needs to be added ASAP.
## Feedback
The content for your Milestone1 was great, but the styling added was amazing. While the styling was not required, it helped make your content easier to read and more engaging. Unfortunately since the styling was not part of the assignment, it will not have any effect on your grade. I also want to caution you to keep your plans for PWP at a manageable scope. I recommend you create a plan that allows for a paired down site for the assignment that can then be customized
with a more complex interface after graduation
