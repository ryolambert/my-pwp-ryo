Marc has been apart of the technology sector for almost two decades now and has been involved with projects and companies across the US and abroad. His biggest issue in working with and hiring new employees is finding individuals who are hungry to learn, expand upon their skillsets, and unafraid to apply their creative passions in the work they do. For the position, he is looking to hire someone who's going to go above and beyond the bare minimum, with a penchant for intuitive designs and innovative solutions. As well as a willingness to undergo rapid personal and professional growth over the next 3-5 years while at the company.  

**Goals:**

 Marc is looking to hire a junior full-stack developer with two to three years experience. His company is setting a rapid pace and sets to take on another dozen major clients in the next quarter alone. He hopes to start taking on at least 1-2 developers quickly. 

 Right now, he has taken time away as project lead and is reviewing applications, referrals, and sending out interview requests to potential hires. After seeing my application, portfolio site, and reviewing a few repositories on Github he is ready to shoot me an email for an interview. 

**User Story:** 

As a user, I need to determine quickly whether this candidate is qualified for the full-stack developer position.
