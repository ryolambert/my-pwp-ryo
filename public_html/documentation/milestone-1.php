					<h3 id="marcussparkes"><em>Marcus Sparkes</em></h3>

					<p>39 years old, Male</p>

					<p><strong>Profession:</strong></p>

					<ul>
						<li>Lead developer and department head of a rapidly growing mid-sized web/app development agency in
							Albuquerque, NM
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong>Technology:</strong></p>

					<ul>
						<li>2018 15" MacBook Pro</li>

						<li>34" Dell Ultrawide Quad HD Monitor</li>

						<li>27" Dell P2715Q</li>

						<li>Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS</li>

						<li>Iphone X</li>

						<li>Apple Watch</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong></p>

					<p>Organized, meticulous, and fast-paced. Heavily focused on getting client product designed, tested, and
						pushed into production on time and at or above spec. Takes a results-based approach to work and
						hiring. He
						relies primarily on portfolios, Github, and referrals from colleagues in the industry. </p>

					<p>Makes it a point to attend local developer events on a quarterly to biannual basis, and on occasion
						hosts local hackathons or Geeks Who Drink event in town. During his free time, he is an avid
						photographer and
						loves taking his dogs on hikes up through the Chama and Pecos. </p>

					<p><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong></p>

					<p>Marc has been apart of the technology sector for almost two decades now and has been involved with
						projects and
						companies across the US and abroad. His biggest issue in working with and hiring new employees is
						finding
						individuals who are hungry to learn, expand upon their skillsets, and unafraid to apply their creative
						passions
						in the work they do. For the position, he is looking to hire someone who's going to go above and
						beyond the
						bare minimum, with a penchant for intuitive designs and innovative solutions. As well as a willingness
						to
						undergo rapid personal and professional growth over the next 3-5 years while at the company. </p>

					<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>

					<p>Marc is looking to hire a junior full-stack developer with two to three years experience. His company
						is
						setting a rapid pace and sets to take on another dozen major clients in the next quarter alone. He
						hopes to
						get at least 2-3 developers and integrated and up to speed with their current project teams within the
						next 2 months. </p>

					<p>Right now, he has taken time away as project lead and is reviewing applications, referrals, and
						sending out
						interview requests to potential hires. After seeing my application, portfolio site, and reviewing a
						few
						repositories on Github he is ready to shoot me an email for an interview. </p>

					<p><strong>User Story:</strong></p>

					<p>As a user, I need to determine quickly whether this candidate is qualified for the full-stack
						developer
						position.</p>
